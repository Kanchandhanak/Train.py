Here's a sample README for an image classification project using Machine Learning on GitHub:

Image Classification using Machine Learning

Project Overview
This project implements an image classification system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy.

Dataset
- Dataset: [Name of dataset used, e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet]
- Number of classes: [Number of classes in the dataset]
- Number of images: [Total number of images in the dataset]

Implementation
- Programming language: Python
- Machine learning framework: TensorFlow/Keras
- Algorithms used: [List of algorithms used, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Transfer Learning]

Model Performance
- Accuracy: [Accuracy achieved on the test dataset]
- Precision: [Precision achieved on the test dataset]
- Recall: [Recall achieved on the test dataset]
- F1-score: [F1-score achieved on the test dataset]

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
